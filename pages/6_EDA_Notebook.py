### ‚úÖ Tasks Performed
1. **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column formats.
   - Converted dates and times into proper formats.
   - Created cleaned dataset `OLA_DataSet_Cleaned.csv`.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Ride volume trends over time.
   - Booking status distribution (success, cancellations, driver not found).
   - Vehicle type usage and total ride distances.
   - Revenue analysis by payment method and customer contributions.
   - Cancellation reasons analysis (customer vs. driver).
   - Distribution of ratings, booking values, and ride distances.

3. **Visualization**
   - Bar charts, pie charts, boxplots, violin plots, KDE plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots.
   - Storytelling with insights from each visualization.

---

### üìä Key Outcomes
- **Ride Demand:** Most rides are concentrated during **evening peak hours (6‚Äì8 PM)**.
- **Booking Success Rate:** ~62% rides successful; ~38% failed (mostly driver cancellations).
- **Vehicle Insights:** **Prime Sedan** and **Auto** dominate demand; **eBike** contributes significantly to total ride distance.
- **Revenue Insights:** **Cash** is still dominant, followed by **UPI**; cards have very low usage.
- **Customer Insights:** Top customers drive a large portion of revenue.
- **Ratings:** Both drivers and customers show a **bimodal pattern** at 4.0 and 5.0, indicating generally high satisfaction.
- **Cancellations:** A majority of incomplete rides are marked as *Unknown reason* ‚Üí signals need for better data capture.

---

### üéØ Conclusion
This EDA project revealed crucial operational and customer insights:
- Enhance **driver reliability** to reduce cancellations.
- Encourage **digital payment adoption** to minimize cash handling.
- Focus on **popular vehicle types & hotspots** for better fleet allocation.
- Leverage insights from ratings to **improve service quality**.

‚úÖ This EDA formed the backbone for the **Power BI Dashboard** and **Streamlit Analytics App**, ensuring data-driven decision making for OLA.
